# Enhanced Real-Time Emotion Detection System

## Overview

This project presents an advanced real-time facial emotion detection system leveraging OpenCV's deep learning-based face detection and a pre-trained mini-XCEPTION model trained on the FER2013 dataset. It is designed to provide high-accuracy emotion recognition with enhanced preprocessing, confidence-based visualization, and temporal smoothing for more stable predictions.

## How to Run

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

* The webcam feed will start.
* Make facial expressions such as happy üòÑ, angry üò°, sad üòû.
* Press `Q` to quit the application.

---

## Output Display

* Detected faces with colored bounding boxes based on predicted emotion
* Emotion labels with confidence percentages
* Emotion confidence bar chart for the primary face
* FPS counter and quit instructions

---

## Technical Enhancements

* **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV DNN with Caffe SSD for fast and accurate detection
* **Image Preprocessing**: Combines CLAHE, histogram equalization, and Gaussian blur for improved model input quality
* **Temporal Smoothing**: A deque-based weighted history buffer stabilizes real-time predictions
* **Visualization**: Live emotion probability bar chart and dynamic label rendering improve usability and feedback

---

## Applications

* Human-computer interaction
* Real-time feedback systems
* Affective computing
* Educational or training tools for emotional intelligence
